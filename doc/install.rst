Install
=======

You should get the source from github directly for the time being. There is a
django-piwik-tracking pypi package you could install and that works, but you
shouldn't use it :-)

Installing Piwik
----------------

1. Install Piwik, see http://piwik.org/docs/installation-optimization/
2. Create a new development site
3. Create a new user
4. Make that user an admin of the development site. If you don't do this the
   remote IPs won't be logged.

Enabling ecommerce tracking
---------------------------

If you wish to use the ecommerce tracking features of the API see
