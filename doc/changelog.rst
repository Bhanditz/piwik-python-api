Changelog
=========

0.3 ()
------

0.3 will probably see some major refactoring and make the tracking API more
pythonic. Will probably break compatibily with 0.2. I hope the API will remain
stable after that.

Hopefully the analytics API will be implemented completely with this release as
well.

0.2 (2012-04-??)
----------------

Yet to be released. 0.2 will stay close to the rather unpleasant PHP code.
Incompatible with 0.1.

- Code refactoring
- Ecommerce tracking support
- Custom variables tracking support
- Action tracking support
- Goal tracking support
- Added unit tests
- Got rid of the Django dependency

0.1 (2012-04-03)
----------------

First, premature release as django-piwik-tracker

- Written in a few hours for a client's project that had just gone live
- Very basic implementation
