   changelog

``python-piwikapi`` is a Python implementation of the Piwik tracking and
analytics API. You can use it to track visitors, ecommerce, generate reports
and much more. See http://piwik.org/docs/analytics-api/ for an overview of
all features.

The project is in alpha status and not ready for production yet. The
tracking API class needs a rewrite and not all features are unit tested yet.
